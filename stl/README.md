# 3D Files

The 3d Design files to create the case for the unspeakabot

## Tools
I'm currently using DesignSpark mechanical to design them, but may switch to Blender soon

## Overall Design
In genral the case will be one piece that has an opening for the on/off button as well as the display screen.

The back panel of the case will be fitted so it can be slid off
